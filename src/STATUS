TrickList::CompareInit.
This could return the compressed range.
Just be careful with lenOld == 0 and lenNew == 0:
ADV would have to become PLAY_DIFFERENT.
Need a new cmpDetailMatrix with the larger range.

Build up parallel functions.
See where CompareInit differs from its new version.

Its first part deals with range and tricks.  If the former trick wins
on rank, the latter on range (with same #tricks), then PLAY_DIFF now.

TrickList::CompareInit must deal with this, but should not return
any of the ADV values (compress into the old scale).

Leading jack:

PB3T or PP39+AA1-
PA3T or PP3T-AA1- (not PB3T, as PP3T worse than PP3T+AA1-)
becomes PA3T or PP3T+AA1-
as PB3T is better and the other is only worse on rank.
BUT the second one in total beats PB3T, so the second should win on rank.
