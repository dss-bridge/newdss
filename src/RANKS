At issue are AA, AB; PA, PB moves below the highest rank.

Ranks that are highest WHEN THEY ARE PLAYED are valid as is.

Otherwise go down 1 level within same rank, if we have it.
Exclude lowest card from LHO and from RHO.


In 11, 3983f, AA1A + PP19 seems odd -- checking Holding generator.


Start with AA and PP, and see what happens.
These are new len-1 segments.
holding is available.
So take out current trick.
Go down 1 level within current rank if possible, otherwise stay.
